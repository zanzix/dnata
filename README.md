We would like you to build a feature for displaying hotel listings.

We recommend you use a tool like [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to mock the data, rather than build out any APIs.

A listing contains the following:

- An image
- A title
- A star rating
- A short description
- A user rating
- List of what's included
- Total price
- Per person price
- View more button

Using whatever libraries and technologies you see fit, create a simple web page that fetches data from an API and displays a listing as described above for each item in the data.

Below is visual design of the listings card we would like you to build. Please note we do not expect you to add all of the features within the visual design.

The technical interview will be a discussion about the solution you have created. We're not expecting a fully functional solution so we recommend spending **up to 4 hours**. We are more interested in the approach you have taken and how well you are able to articulate your decision making, your design and any future enhancements you would make.

We're looking for the following:

- Easy to maintain
- Easy to scale
- Easy to pickup
- Responsive
- Automated tests
- Accessibility
- Semantic code

Feel free to make and state assumptions on any details not covered in the challenge.
